I joined the ENCODE lab at <a href="https://www.westlake.edu.cn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Westlake University</a> as a visiting student advised by <a href="https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/huan-wang.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Huan Wang</a> in the summer of 2025.</p> <p>I mainly work on <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, <strong>Model Compression</strong>, and <strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>. I am also deeply interested in LLMs/VLMs. I worked on instance segmentation of PolSAR images via contrastive learning under the guidance of Professor Haixia Bi in my sophomore year, which sparked my interest in Computer Vision and Unsupervised Learning. At ENCODE Lab, I focused on accelerating inference for quantized models, which gave me hands-on experience with quantization techniques and CUDA programming.</p> </body></html>
